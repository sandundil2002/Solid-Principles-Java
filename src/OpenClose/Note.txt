Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Definition : Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Explanation : You should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its source code.
This is typically achieved through abstraction, inheritance, or interfaces.
