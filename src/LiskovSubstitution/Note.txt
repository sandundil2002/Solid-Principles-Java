Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Definition : Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Explanation : Subclasses should extend the behavior of the parent class without changing its existing behavior.
In other words, a subclass should behave in such a way that it can replace its parent class without causing issues in the program.
