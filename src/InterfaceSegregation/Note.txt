Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Definition : Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Explanation : Instead of having large, monolithic interfaces, you should break them down into smaller,
more specific interfaces so that clients only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them.
