Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Definition : A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.

Explanation : Each class or module should be responsible for a single part of the functionality provided by the software.
If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one responsibility may affect the others,
making the system harder to maintain and test.
