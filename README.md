<h1>SOLID Principles in Java</h1>

<p>SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create flexible, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented software systems. These principles serve as guidelines to ensure clean, modular code that is easy to extend and maintain. While it's not always possible to apply all principles perfectly, adhering to them where applicable can significantly improve the overall software design.</p>

<h2>What are SOLID Principles?</h2>

<p>SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that promote good software architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>S</b> ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
  <li><b>O</b> pen/Closed Principle (OCP)</li>
  <li><b>L</b> iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</li>
  <li><b>I</b> nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)</li>
  <li><b>D</b> ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</li>
</ul>

<p>These principles help developers write code that is easier to understand, test, and extend over time.</p>

<h2>The SOLID Principles</h2>

<h3><b>1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</b></h3>

<p>A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one job.</p>

<h3><b>2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</b></h3>

<p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.</p>

<h3><b>3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</b></h3>

<p> Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the programâ€™s behavior.</p>

<h3><b>4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</b></h3>

<p>Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.</p>

<h3><b>5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP))</b></h3>

<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>SOLID principles help create scalable, maintainable, and flexible software. While it's not always necessary to apply all five principles strictly, using them where appropriate leads to cleaner and more robust code. By following these guidelines, developers can reduce technical debt and make their systems easier to extend and maintain over time.</p>
